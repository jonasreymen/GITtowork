    <h2>How to make Tiramisu:</h2>
    
    <h3>step 1:</h3>
    <p>Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed for      about 5 minutes, or until very thick and light yellow. Lower the speed to medium and add 1/4 cup rum, 1/4 cup espresso, and the mascarpone. Whisk until smooth.</p>
    
    <h3>step 2:</h3>
    <p>Combine the remaining 1/4 cup rum and 1 1/4 cups espresso in a shallow bowl. Dip 1 side of each ladyfinger in the espresso/rum mixture and line the bottom of a 9 by 12 by 2-inch dish. Pour half the espresso cream mixture evenly on top. Dip 1 side of the remaining ladyfingers in the espresso/rum mixture and place them in a second layer in the dish. Pour the rest of the espresso cream over the top. Smooth the top and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.</p>
    
    <h3>step 3:</h3>
    <p>Before serving, sprinkle the top with shaved chocolate and dust lightly with confectioners' sugar, if desired.</p>
